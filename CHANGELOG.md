# Changelog

## [v1.3.4] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- BookFusion library browser moved from Settings to the File Transfer menu. Once your account is linked, a "Bookfusion" row appears alongside Join a Network / Connect to Calibre / Create Hotspot. The entry is hidden when no account is linked, so unlinked devices see no change.

## [v1.3.0-carousel] - 2026-05-27

This release tracks upstream CrossInk v1.3.0 selectively. We deliberately
skipped the v1.3.0 cache-key migration, `RecentBooksStore::pruneMissing`,
and the wider sleep-screen / page-as-sleep restructure — those touched
persistent state in ways that risked the `.crosspoint/` corruption we
already saw during the initial v1.3.0 merge attempt.

What landed instead:

### Added
- **Pre-render next-page cache** — after the current page is fully drawn,
  the next text-only page is silently rendered into the framebuffer
  behind your back. The next forward page turn skips prewarm + page
  render and just paints the status bar over the cached buffer, shaving
  ~150-200 ms per page turn on text-heavy books.
- **Quick Resume on auto-sleep** — opt-in via Settings → Display →
  "Quick Resume on Auto-Sleep". When enabled and the device auto-sleeps
  from inside a book, the framebuffer is saved to
  `/.crosspoint/sleep_frame.bin` and the panel keeps your page visible
  with a small crescent moon hint next to the percent. On wake, the
  saved page is restored before the splash so you land directly back
  on your last page within ~200-400 ms of pressing power. Manual
  power-button sleeps still use the regular sleep screen.
- **Carousel side-cover perspective cache** — the Flow carousel caches
  each side-cover's post-perspective bitmap on first render. Subsequent
  scrolls hit the cache for 3 of 4 sides, cutting scroll-to-scroll
  latency by ~2-3×.
- **Carousel pre-decoded thumbnails** — covers decode once at home
  enter into RAM grids and render via direct framebuffer writes,
  skipping the BMP header parse + per-row quantization on every scroll.
- **Time-to-read projection rework** — the Flow carousel's projected
  total reading time now uses your lifetime average completed-book time
  during the first ~10 minutes of a new book, scaled by your pages/sec
  on this book vs. your lifetime rate. The previous percent-based
  formula collapsed when the user used the chapter selector to skip
  the preface/intro, projecting a 1h total for an 8h book; the new
  formula stays grounded.
- **X3 battery percentage smoothing** — the BQ27220 fuel gauge's
  documented FCC-miscalibration behavior would cause the displayed
  percentage to snap from 25-30% to 100% during charging. We now
  rate-limit displayed-% changes to 2% per 1.5s poll, smoothing chip
  jumps over ~30-60 s. Same direction-lock approach upstream
  issue #1444 suggested. X4 keeps its existing ADC + moving-average.

### Changed
- **Reader menu**: Footnotes shortcut now sits above Select Chapter
  when the book has footnote markup — matches the common task in
  non-fiction.
- **Reader menu**: long book titles now wrap to 2 lines instead of
  truncating with an ellipsis. Short titles stay single-line; layout
  shifts only when wrapping actually fires.
- **Tilt-to-turn shortcut** now shows a confirmation popup
  ("Tilt Page Turn: On" / "Tilt Page Turn: Off") when toggled. Without
  the popup the toggle is silent and the user has to physically tilt
  to test whether the shortcut fired.
- **Auto-sleep stats discount**: when the auto-sleep timeout ends a
  reader session, the idle time since the last page turn is subtracted
  from the committed reading time. Reading 5 min then leaving the
  device idle for the 10-min auto-sleep timeout now logs ~5 min, not
  ~15 min.
- **Quick Resume sleep hint**: now a real crescent moon (was a solid
  circle), placed in the status bar next to the percent text (was
  bottom-left corner). The full reader chrome — battery bar, progress
  bar, chapter title, percent — stays visible during sleep.

### Fixed
- **Recent Books grid / Book Stats header**: a very long author name
  used to consume all available width, leaving the title rendered at
  0 px (effectively invisible). We now reserve at least 1/3 of the
  budget for the title; the author truncates with ellipsis instead.

### Explicitly skipped from v1.3.0 (and why)
- **`RecentBooksStore::pruneMissing()`** — caused `.crosspoint/recent.json`
  corruption when `Storage.exists()` returned false transiently during
  boot. Issue is upstream; we intentionally did not port this.
- **Recent Books long-press menu** — bundled with pruneMissing in the
  upstream merge. Would need surgical separation.
- **Cache-key migration / EPUB low-memory rewrites** — high risk for
  the maturity of our base; deferred indefinitely.
- **Minimal sleep screen mode** — overlaps with Quick Resume.

## [v1.2.11.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Flow carousel: selected-cover outline now stays on the centered cover even after the cursor moves into the bottom menu strip, so the carousel area no longer repaints on every carousel↔menu transition.
- Flow carousel: progress bar now hugs the actual cover bottom (covers with non-3:5 aspect ratios no longer leave a dead gap above the bar). Time text follows the bar to keep the bar↔time spacing constant; title/author stays slot-anchored so the text rhythm is unchanged.
- X4 only: bumped `topPadding` by 6 px so every header rect and the content rows below it sit a consistent distance below the lowered battery bar.
- Reduced bar↔time spacing by 2 px to compensate for the always-on selection outline pulling the bar visually closer to the cover.

### Added
- Memory-backed `Bitmap` reads: the home carousel now slurps each thumb file into RAM once at home enter (capped at 32 KB per entry) and reads through the cached bytes on subsequent scrolls — eliminates per-scroll SD opens and shaves ~50–75 ms off cover-to-cover transitions.
- Robust fallback chain in `UITheme::getCoverThumbPath`: exact `thumb_WxH.bmp` → legacy `thumb_H.bmp` → any other `thumb_*.bmp` in the book's cache dir → `cover.bmp` → exact path for generation. Picks up stale thumbs from earlier firmware sizes instead of falling through to the solid-black silhouette.
- Self-healing recents state: `loadRecentCovers` and `RecentBooksGridActivity` no longer persist `coverBmpPath = ""` on a transient `generateThumbBmp` failure; the next pass re-derives the template via `RECENT_BOOKS.getDataFromBook(...)` and retries, so heap-pressure failures no longer strand books in the no-cover state forever.

### Fixed
- Flow carousel: cover↔menu transitions were re-rendering the whole carousel because `carouselDisplayIndex` encoded mode into the cache key (`recentCount + lastBookIndex` vs `selectorIndex`). Replaced with a mode-invariant `centeredBookIdx` so the cover-buffer cache survives every carousel↔menu toggle.
- Flow carousel: side covers on X4 sat too far right and overflowed the screen edge — right-side X positions now mirror from the screen's right edge so the stack is symmetric on both the 528-px X3 and the 480-px X4.
- Cover rendering: `drawBitmap1Bit` now supports upscaling, not just downscaling. Small thumbnails (legacy cached sizes, or books with tiny source JPEGs) used to render at 1:1 in the top-left of an oversized slot — they now fill the slot the caller asked for.

## [v1.2.11.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Synced upstream CrossInk v1.2.11 + v1.2.11.1 fixes and features (Lyra Carousel theme skipped; Flow + Minimal are the two carousel themes).
- New Minimal home theme — clean home page with one large cover, available alongside Flow.
- In-reader **Controls** menu opens the full Settings → Controls list without exiting the book; in-reader Reader Options now exposes "Manage Fonts" and "Customise Status Bar" actions.
- **Custom sleep timer picker** — `Time to Sleep` is now a 1–30-minute integer instead of fixed presets. Existing JSON settings migrate to the closest minute value; existing binary settings reset to 10 minutes on first boot.
- BMP viewer now shows Prev/Next button hints and accepts both bottom-rocker and side-input directions.
- KOReader Sync: long-press to clear all bookmarks, hold Select to delete a single bookmark.
- File Browser: long-press a book to delete its cache or mark it Finished / Unfinished.
- Custom font-manager actions split into "Download All" and "Update All" entries.
- Confirmation toast when deleting a book's cache from the reader.

### Changed
- Web file-transfer filename byte limit raised from 100 → 150; uploads now preserve the original file extension.
- Deep sleep entry now shuts WiFi down before waiting on the power-button release.
- Settings: removed the "Progress Bar Thickness" option (no longer adjustable).
- Settings: "Show Battery" toggle now actually hides/shows the top battery bar on every menu surface.
- X4 only: top battery bar moved 4 px lower for better balance with the wider top bezel.

### Fixed
- Landscape EPUB inline images no longer clip when the bottom edge overlaps the screen margin.
- SD-card font picker no longer reopens after selection; in-reader font-size changes now rebuild the page layout correctly.
- KOReader Sync: authentication and parsing fixes for Calibre-Web-Automated and other non-strict servers.
- EPUB rendering: characters from unsupported charsets no longer overlap; advance-table and prewarm now degrade gracefully under low memory.
- JPEG decoder: heap-aware allocation via `unique_ptr`, wider rendering envelope, progressive-JPEG detection.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Added a `Recent Books View` setting so the dedicated Recent Books screen can switch between the classic list and a 3x3 cover grid.
- Added more flexible reader controls, including orientation-aware front/side button settings, nav-only or all-button front inversion, tilt page turn shortcuts, and side-button long-press rotation actions.
- Added a per-session auto page turn interval picker with values from 5 to 120 seconds.
- Added a file-browser Home/Back long-press action for toggling hidden files and folders.
- Added EPUB rendering and diagnostics improvements, including visible `<hr>` separators and heap logs around section rebuilds, image extraction, page serialization, and sleep-cache rebuilds.
- Added reader font coverage for block redactions, black-square ornaments, Greek category letters, and turned-comma punctuation (PR #104).
- Added simulator tools for testing sleep/wake behavior and smoke-testing common screens and EPUB reader menus.

### Changed
- Reduced Controls settings section spacing so the grouped controls fit better on X3 screens.
- Made front reader long-press actions trigger when the hold delay is reached while normal page turns still trigger on release.
- Used the fast EPUB spine/TOC indexing path for books with 300+ spine entries so heavily split books build `book.bin` faster on first open.
- Allowed the web file manager and WebDAV to browse dot-prefixed hidden files when hidden files are enabled, matching the device file browser.

### Fixed
- Fixed reader button and shortcut behavior, including X3 power-button wake filtering, folder delete long-press timing, and WiFi scan/connect screens that could not be exited while work was in progress.
- Fixed RoundedRaff home-menu, keyboard, and button-hint rendering issues so Settings remains reachable and compact labels no longer overlap or disappear.
- Fixed font and glyph handling by reducing persistent SD-card font advance-cache memory, releasing optional font caches before image extraction only when heap is tight, and showing a visible replacement symbol when compact UI fonts lack `U+FFFD`.
- Fixed KOReader Sync authentication diagnostics and an in-reader sync crash, including clearer handling when a server or proxy returns non-JSON content.
- Fixed EPUB text rendering for redactions, whitespace-only XHTML text nodes, simple black CSS span backgrounds, list bullets in `<li><p>...</p></li>` items, and very long base64-like text runs.
- Fixed EPUB image, thumbnail, and section-rebuild stability so image-heavy chapters use less temporary memory, scale images more reliably, avoid stale dimensions, and suppress optional image work earlier under heap pressure.
- Fixed EPUB low-memory and cache safety by skipping optional next-chapter indexing and sleep-page cache rebuilds when heap is tight, failing safely with a malformed-book warning and Home exit path, rebuilding incompatible fork-written caches, and handling low-memory CSS parsing, truncated SD writes, invalid serialized strings, and failed temp-cache promotion.
- Fixed a Home crash after clearing reading cache by skipping optional EPUB thumbnail rebuilds when the source EPUB cache is missing.
- Fixed reader prewarm behavior by skipping image decoding, keeping mixed-style font glyphs cached together, and avoiding section rebuilds for render-quality-only option changes.
- Fixed concurrent render/storage crashes by serializing `GfxRenderer` scratch-buffer access, shared SPI bus access, and failed SPI lock cleanup.
- Fixed Recent Books, EPUB/XTC thumbnail caches, deleted-folder metadata, and XTC cover scaling so cached book data stays in sync and grid covers fill their slots correctly.
- Fixed simulator build configuration so SDL2 and simulator-provided network/OTA shims compile cleanly.

## [v1.2.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Cleaned up EPUB table rendering by removing synthetic row/cell labels and defaulting table cells to readable left alignment
- Allow simple EPUB tables with full-width note rows so a single `colspan` cell spanning the whole table no longer forces the entire table back to paragraph fallback

### Fixed
- Fix power-button shortcut conflicts outside the reader so reader-only actions fall back to `Confirm` while Sleep, Refresh, Screenshot, Sync Progress, and File Transfer remain real power actions. Those that had short-press power button to act as sleep saw unstable behavior previously. This should be fixed now
- Fix a potential crash when using `Go to %` in EPUBs
- Fix a potential crash when entering sleep with Page Overlay enabled if the cached EPUB page data is invalid
